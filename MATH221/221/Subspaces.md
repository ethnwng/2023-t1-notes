The same thing as a [[Span]] except we do not have a particular set of spanning vectors.

***Definition*** a **subspace** of $\mathbf{R^n}$ is a [[Subset]] *V* of $\mathbf{R^n}$ which satisfies:
- ***Non-emptiness***: The zero vector is in *V*
- ***Closure under addition***: If *u* and *v* are in *V*, then $u+v$ is also in *V*
- ***Closure under scalar multiplication***: If *v* is in *V* and *c* is in **R**, then *cv* is also in *V*.

**Note:** not all subsets are subspaces as some do not satisfy all three properties.

#### Common types of Subspaces
**Note:** Subspaces are spans, and spans are subspaces. 

If $V=Span\{v_1,v_2,\dots\}$ we can say that $V$ is the subspace ***spanned by*** or ***generated by*** the vectors $v_{1}, v_{2}, \dots, v_{p}$ we call $\{v_{1},v_{2},\dots ,v_{p}\}$ a  ***spanning set*** for $V$

Every matrix always creates *two subspaces*. [[Column Space]] and [[Null Space]].

 [[Column Space]] [[Null Space]] [[Basis]]

Given $A$ is an $m\times n$ matrix, 

*The basis and dimension for Col(A) is,*

Col(A) by definition is the span of of the columns of A, and the span of the pivot columns of A.

The basis for Col(A) is the set of pivot columns of A. 
$\therefore$ The dimension of Col(A) is the number of pivot columns


*The basis for the null space of A*

Null space is the solution set to $A\mathbf{x}=0$,

A **subset** is any collection of points of $\mathbf{R^n}$ 

#### Example
The unit circle $$C=\{(x,y) \in R^{2} \ | \ x^{2}+y^{2}=1\}$$ is a subset of $\mathbf{R^2}$.

$C$ was described in *set-builder notation*, we can read this as "*C* is the set of all ordered pairs ($x,y$) in $R^2$ such that $x^{2}+y^{2}=1$"

### Set builder notation
The verticle line means "such that", therefore the **left** side of the line represents 
"the set of all things of this form" where the **right** side is the condition that those things must satisfy to be in the set.

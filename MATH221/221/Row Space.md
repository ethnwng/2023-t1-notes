*Definition*: The *row space* of a matrix A is the span of the rows of $A$. Equivalently the same as $Col(A^T)$ 

Lots of equivalence / orthogonality between column and row spaces related by [[Orthogonal Vectors#Orthogonal Complement|their orthogonal complements]]
$$Row(A)^{\perp}=Null(A)$$
$$Col(A)^{\perp}=Null(A^T)$$

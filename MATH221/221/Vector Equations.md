***Definition*** A **vector equation** is an equation involving  a linear combination of vectors with possibly unknown coefficients

#### Example
$$x\begin{pmatrix}1\\2\\6\end{pmatrix}+y\begin{pmatrix}1\\2\\3\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}8\\16\\3\end{pmatrix}$$
A vector equation of two variables, which can be re-written as a system of equations.
In english, For what $(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$ do my two vectors $\begin{pmatrix}1\\2\\6\end{pmatrix},\begin{pmatrix}1\\2\\3\end{pmatrix}$ equal $\begin{pmatrix}8\\16\\3\end{pmatrix}$?

$$\left\{\begin{align*}x+y=8\\2x+2y=16\\6x+3y=3\end{align*}\right\}$$
Asking whether or not a vector equation has a solution is the same as asking if a given vector is a [[Linear Combination]] of some other given vectors.

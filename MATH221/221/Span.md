Let $v_{1}, v_{2}, \dots , v_{k}$ be vectors in $R^{n}$. The **span** of $v_{1}, v_{2}, \dots , v_{k}$ is the collection of all [[linear combination]] of $v_{1}, v_{2}, \dots , v_{k}$, denoted by $$Span\{v_{1},v_{2}, \dots v_{k}\}$$
For a matrix $A$ to span some Real space ($\mathbb{R}^x$), the matrix must have pivot's in every row.

To check if the vectors $\begin{pmatrix} 1\\0 \end{pmatrix}$, $\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ span all of $\mathbb{R^2}$, row reduce the matrix $A = \begin{pmatrix}1  & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$.

The reduced matrix has pivots in every row, therefore the two vectors span all of $\mathbb{R^2}$.
- Spanning all of $\mathbb{R^2}$ is equivalent to saying the linear combination of all these vectors create a plane in $\mathbb{R^2}$ geometrically.
- If it were $\mathbb{R^3}$ then it would create a 3-space region.

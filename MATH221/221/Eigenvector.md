*Definition*
Let $A$ be a $n\times n$ matrix, an **eigenvector** of $A$ is a **non-zero** vector such that $$A\mathbf{v}=\lambda\mathbf{v}$$ for some scalar $\lambda$.

- Says that a vector $\vec{v}$ multiplied by some matrix $A$ just produces a *scaled* version of $\vec{v}$

$\lambda$ is called the [[Eigenvalue]] 

*Theorem* if $\vec{v_{1}},\vec{v_{2}},...,\vec{v_{k}}$ are eigenvectors for $A$, with distinct [[Eigenvalue]] $\lambda_{1},\lambda_{2}, ... , \lambda_{k}$m then the set $\{\vec{v_{1}}, \vec{v_{2}}, ... , \vec{v_{k}}\}$ are linearly independent.

*Definition*
Let $A$ be a $n\times n$ matrix, an **eigenvector** of $A$ is a **non-zero** vector such that $$A\mathbf{v}=\lambda\mathbf{v}$$ for some scalar $\lambda$.

- Says that a vector $\vec{v}$ multiplied by some matrix $A$ just produces a *scaled* version of $\vec{v}$

$\lambda$ is called the [[Eigenvalue]]

[[Dot Products]]
*Def* Two vectors $\vec{x},\vec{y} \ \in \mathbb{R}^n$ are **orthogonal** if the $\vec{x}\cdot\vec{y}=0$ denoted by $\vec{x}\perp \vec{y}$.

##### Orthogonal Complement
*Def* Let $W = \mathbb{R}^n$ then its *orthogonal complement* denoted $W^{\perp}$ is$$W^{\perp}=\left\{\vec{v}\in \mathbb{R}^{n} | \vec{v}\cdot\vec{w}=0\ \ \forall\vec{w}\in W\right\}$$
Pretty much the set of vectors in that for any vector in $W$ the dot product between them is zero.

**Example**
Let $W = {\mathbf{0}} \sub \mathbb{R}^n$

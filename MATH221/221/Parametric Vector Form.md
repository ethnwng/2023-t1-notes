##### Parametric Vector Form (Homogenous Case)
Let *A* be an *m $\times$ n* matrix. Suppose that the free variables in the homogeneous equation $Ax=0$ are, $x_{3}, x_6$ and $x_8$. 
1. Find the reduced row echelon form of A
2. Write the parametric form of the solution set, including the redundant equations. $x_{3}= x_{3}, x_{6}= x_{6}, x_{8}= x_8$. Put equations for all of the $x_i$ in order.
3. Make a single vector equation from these equations by making the coefficients of $x_{3}, x_6$  and $x_8$ into vectors $v_{3}, v_{6}$ and $v_{8}$.
The solutions to $Ax =0$ will then be expressed in the form $$x=x_{3}v_{3}+x_{6}v_{6}+x_{8}v_{8}$$
for some vectors $v_{3}, v_{6}$ and $v_{8}$ in $\mathbf{R^n}$, and any scalars $x_{3}, x_{6}, x_{8}$.

The [[Solution Set]] is then written as $Span\{v_{3}, v_{6}, v_{8}\}$

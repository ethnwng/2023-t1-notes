*Definition*: Let $c_{1}, c_{2}, \dots, c_{k}$ be scalars and let $v_{1}, v_{2}, \dots , v_{k}$ be vectors in $\mathbf{R^n}$. The vector in $\mathbf{R^n}$ $$c_{1}v_{1}+c_{2}v_{2}+\dots +c_{k}v_{k}$$
is called a ***linear combination*** of the vectors $v_{1}, v_{2}, \dots , v_{k}$, with **weights** or **coefficients** $c_{1}, c_{2}, \dots , c_{k}$. 

Geometrically, a linear combination is obtained by *stretching/shrinking* the vectors according to each coefficient and then adding them together.

In english this means, some vector $\mathbf{u}$ can be created by some equation which combines $\mathbf{v_1},\mathbf{v_{2},}\dots, \mathbf{v_k}$ each with some scalar coefficient.

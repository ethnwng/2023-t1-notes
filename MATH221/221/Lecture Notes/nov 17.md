Given $C$ is invertible then its columns are linearly independent.

- Any vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$ can be expressed as a linearly combination of the vectors in the basis.
- Using similarity we are trying to convert certain basis vectors to the basis vector of the similar matrix.

Given $\mathbf{e}_{1},\mathbf{e}_{2}$ where $e_{1}=\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0\end{pmatrix},$



*Key Proposition: If two matrices A, Bare similar, then A and B have the same characteristic polynomial.*
- Same characteristic polynomial means they have the same [[Eigenvalue]]s 
If $A=CBC^-$ then $C^{-1}$ takes $\lambda$ [[Eigenvector]]s of $A$ to the $\lambda$ eigenvectors of $B$ and $C$ does the opposite.

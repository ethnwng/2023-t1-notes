Proving the composition of two transformations is a linear transformation
$$\begin{align*}T:\mathbb{R}^{n} \rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{m}\\ u: \mathbb{R}^{p}  \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n}\end{align*}$$

Given $T\circ U(c\vec{u})$

If both $T$ and $U$ are [[Linear transformations]] then the composition of them is linear. 



##### Theorem
Let $T,U$ be composable in transformation with standard matrices A and B respectively. Then $T\circ U$ is a linear transformation with standard matrix AB.

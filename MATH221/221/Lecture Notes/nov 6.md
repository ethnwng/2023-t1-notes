*Def* The **parallelepiped** determined by *n* vectors $\mathbf{v_{1}},\mathbf{v_{2}}...\mathbf{v_{n}}$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is the subset $$p=\{a_{1}v_{1}+a_{2}v_{2}+a_{3}v_{3}+..+a_{n}v_{n}\}$$Where all constants $a_{i}$ must be between $0$ and $1$ 

The *unit cube* is the parallelepiped determined by the [[standard coordinates vectors]] in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$


*Theorem* The volume of the parallelepiped [[Determinant]] by $\{v_{1},v_{2},...v_{n}\}$ is $|det(A)|$ where the columns of A are made up by each vector $v_{i}$

*Proposition*
If $A$ is an $n\times n$ matrix with corresponding linear transformation $T: \mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ if $T(\vec{x})=A\vec{x}$ for all $\vec{x}\in\mathbb{R}^n$ and c is unit cube in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Then $$vol(T(c))=|det(A)|$$

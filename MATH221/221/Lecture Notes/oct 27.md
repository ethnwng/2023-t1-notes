**Uses of [[Invertible Matrices]]**
If $A$ has an inverse it means that in RREF it must be the identity matrix. Therefore
$$A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$$
Will always have one solution

We can "undo" the transformation by taking the inverse of $\mathbf{b}$
$$AA^{-1}\mathbf{x} =A^{-1}\mathbf{b}$$
$$\mathbf{x}=A^{-1}\mathbf{b}$$

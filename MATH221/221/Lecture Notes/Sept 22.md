*Let A be a 3 × 3 matrix and let b be a vector in R3. Suppose the matrix equation Ax = b has  
infinitely many solutions. Then for any other vector v in R3, the matrix equation Ax = v is 
consistent*

- **A** can only have a solution to any $\vec{v}$ if it contains 3 pivots. $A = 3\times 3$

*Let A be a 3 × 4 matrix and let b be a vector in R3. Suppose that the [[Solution Set]]  to the matrix  equation Ax = b can be written in parametric form with exactly one parameter t. Then any vector  
v in R3 is in the span of the columns of A.*
- one parameter means a pivot in every row
- one free variable
- 3 pivot rows
$\therefore$ $Ax = \vec{v}$ has a solution for every $\vec{v}$ 

#### Translated Span

$$\pmatrix{x \\ y \\ z} = \pmatrix{2 \\ 1 \\ 0} + t\pmatrix{1\\-3\\1}$$
- Does not have the zero vector in its [[Span]]
- Called *translated* span because all points are translated by the vector $\pmatrix{2\\1\\0}$
**only homogeneous equations have a full span**

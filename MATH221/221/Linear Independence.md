**All** coefficients in the vector equation $$x_{1}\vec{v_{1}}+x_{2}\vec{v_{2}}+\dots+ x_{k}\vec{v_{k}} = 0$$ Would have to be zero.

- All of the coefficients would have to be zero since if it were not, then one vector is simply a scalar multiple of the other.

##### Linear Dependence
Occurs when the equation $$x_{1}\vec{v_{1}}+x_{2}\vec{v_{2}}+\dots+ x_{k}\vec{v_{k}} = 0$$
is satisfied by **non-zero coefficients**. 

###### Example
$v_{1}=\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ $v_{2}=\begin{pmatrix}2 \\ 2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ 

Then the equation $$x_{1}\vec{v_{1}} + x_{2}\vec{v_{2}} = 0$$ is satisfied with $x_{1}=-2$ and $x_{2}=1$. Both non zero coefficients. 

- Simple check is to see if the two vectors are scalar multiples of one another. We can check with matrix reduction for larger sets of vectors.
